                It feels like just yesterday that I added you on Snapchat, and little did I know that it would mark the beginning of an incredible journey with you. These two months have been nothing short of magical, and I find myself thinking back to that day with a smile on my face.
                Adding you on Snapchat was like finding a hidden gem in a vast digital world. You came into my life like a marvelous occurrence, a bright and beautiful surprise that I never expected but am eternally grateful for.
                Every day with you has been a new adventure, filled with laughter, shared dreams, and countless moments that have made my heart skip a beat. Your presence in my life has brought a sense of completeness and happiness that I never knew was missing.
                I cherish the love, understanding, and companionship we share. With each passing day, I'm more certain that being with you is where I want to be. You've touched my heart in ways I never thought possible, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes us.
                Here's to the first two months of many more to come. I look forward to creating more beautiful memories with you and falling even deeper in love with the incredible person you are. Thank you for being the shining star in my life, Ti-ihka. I love you more with each passing day, and I can't wait to celebrate many more milestones together. üíï‚ú®ü•Ç

                <div class="message">Dear jay,

                  I‚Äôm not too good with words or expressing myself the best but imma try for yuüò≠. 
                  
                  Happy three months babe‚ù§Ô∏è 
                  
                  Quite frankly I don‚Äôt know where to start and if I do I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll know how to end. I started writing this on the 20th cus I needed time to fully process the fact that I somehow managed to get lucky and find yu. Words can‚Äôt describe how
                   much I appreciate and love yu.. You‚Äôve healed wounds that I didn‚Äôt even know were still open and you‚Äôve rekindled something that was gone for a while. I love how gentle you are in nature and how nurturing you are. In These three months you‚Äôve 
                   taught me a lot. So much that it probably can‚Äôt even fit all in one paragraph but I‚Äôm grateful. All the love and endearment you‚Äôve shown me has taught me how to love and understand better. You‚Äôve taught me how to communicate and that‚Äôs something
                    I‚Äôve struggled with. Yu take ur time with me and no matter how much I irritate yu or upset yu, you never let it change the way you love me and I love yu for that. Every morning I wake up and I‚Äôm grateful for yu. My friends don‚Äôt know yu well but
                     they call yu literal heaven sent to me. Every month that we are together is another month of happiness and love I get to endure and experience. Jay, we have our ups and put downs of course, and through them
                  All I love yu. It may seem like I‚Äôm mad and wtv but it‚Äôs because I genuinely mess w yu. Three months ago when yu asked for the one month trial and I agreed, I never expected it to become something I hold so dearly to my heart. To this dayyyy I remember
                   trying to break up a yu and you told me noüò≠. From that day on I vowed within myself to try my best to keep us together and hold us together. I‚Äôm not much of an emotional person or the soft feelings for too long but from The bottom of my fat ass, thank yu‚ù§Ô∏è. 
                   Thank yu for helping me to grow, thank you for helping me to become a better woman, a better future wife and a better person on a whole. No matter what it is whether it be distance or time, life or death, or the moon and stars jay, I‚Äôll always love yu‚ù§Ô∏è happy three months daddy‚ù§Ô∏è</div>

                      <div class="messageM">Dear Ti-ikha I've exhausted the amount of heartfelt words I can share with you. But I can try my best to do so once more. Ti-ikha Edwards, my dearest, as we celebrate our third anniversary together, 
                        I want to take a moment to express just how deeply you've touched my life. From the day we first crossed paths, I knew that I had discovered something truly special. Your presence in my world has been nothing short of a blessing, and I want you to understand that I will never give up on you.
                        Our journey began with a serendipitous encounter, an online connection that felt like fate. Little did I know that this chance meeting would evolve into a profound and enduring love story. Over these three months, we've faced our
                         share of challenges, but each one has only strengthened our bond. Your strength, resilience, and unwavering support have shown me the depths of your character, and I'm more in love with you than ever.
                       Ti-ikha, baby, on this special day, let me remind you that you're my rock, my muse, my everything. I promise you, no matter what life throws our way, I won't give up on us. Our love is a beautiful journey, 
                       and I'm committed to traveling it with you forever, come what may. You're the missing piece to my puzzle, and I can't imagine my life without you in it.
                        You've shown me what it means to be truly cherished and understood, and I want you to know that I will stand by your side through every season of life. You're a remarkable woman with incredible
                         dreams, and I'm here to support you in every endeavor. As we look to the future, I am excited to see all the adventures and happiness that await us. 
                       Happy third anniversary, Ti-ikha. With you, I've discovered a love that is unyielding, and I can't wait to make many more cherished memories with you by my side. 
                       You've touched my heart in ways words can't express, but I hope you always remember that I will never give up on you and our beautiful love story. Here's to us and to many more years of happiness and togetherness.
                       This may not compare to what you probably have in store for me as ur gift this anniversary but I've given my all. I hope I may find smth that's new next time.
                        Maybe I can figure that out when ur in my arms, when we're both in bed cuddling and embracing each other. One day I hope my lips will feel yours and we will hold hands together until time ends. 
                        (Lemmi not mention all the smashin and pounding we gon be doin ) .
                        ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). But one day I hope we can do everything and anything together, I hope that you'll be mine and mine alone until the day we're old and rotten. Or till the day some miracle happens and the world restarts just for me to find you again. I am truly happy I found you bby. And I hope to see many more days, months, weeks and years with you.

                       I love you. Thank you for existing.</div>
